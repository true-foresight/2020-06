We will get the nCoV virus naturally or through a vaccine sooner or later. It is better to get it during the spring or summer season in the northern hemisphere when the human immune system is more up beat. Our body's gut biome with healthy microorganisms and bacteriophages (viruses) are also sufficiently active during this season to weaken or ward off various (but not all) strains of influenza and corona viruses which, are a part of our natural surroundings.

Overuse, misuse and abuse of disinfectants and soapy detergents is likely to have a very adverse effect on our ecology and individual bodies. We are likely to kill many healthy flora and fauna including microorganisms that help us stay safe from harmful ones. We are likely to have already accelerated the evolution of "super bugs" and super resistent corona viruses by misusing and abusing disinfectants. 

Notably, winter is the toughest season for survival of any creature. The northern hemisphere has the highest population size and population density of human beings compared to the southern hemisphere. During winter time, with lower sunshine, the flora and fauna inside our body become more dormant while viruses like influenza and corona tend to become more active. A social habit of gathering indoors in larger groups for holiday celebrations also contributes to the spread of viral infections. All this is merely the ebb and flow of nature. However getting caught aimless and hapless during the "low tide" of winter is quite problematic for human beings. Infants and elderly are particularly vulnerable during the winter season. 

Add to all these facts the economic and social dormancy of our societies built on agrarian cycles and you get a massive second wave of corona infections. A tsunami of corona infections would be logically expected particularly in a country like Canada during the coming fall-winter due to a larger elderly plus children population compared to that of working age adults. 

Like any creature naturally endowed with intelligence we can prepare for the winter during these flourishing months of spring and summer. We can practice and prepare ourselves to prevent being despirited and utterly disrupted in the winter. The list of such tasks worth practicing are outlined in the article: [Care & Consideration](https://github.com/true4all/caregivers/blob/master/README.md)
